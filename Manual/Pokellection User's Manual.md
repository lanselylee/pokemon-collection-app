## 8. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Pok√©mon display when launching the application
- Check your internet connection
- The application requires internet access to fetch Pok√©mon data from the PokeAPI
- If the problem persists, try restarting the application

#### Images not loading
- Ensure you have internet access (images are loaded from the PokeAPI)
- Some images might take longer to load depending on your connection speed
- If an image fails to load, you'll see **"Error loading image"** in place of the Pok√©mon sprite

#### Search or filter not working
- Ensure you've spelled the Pok√©mon name correctly
- Try using partial names (e.g., `"char"` instead of `"charizard"`)
- If filtering by type doesn't work, try selecting **"All Types"** and then your desired type again

#### Unable to save collection
- Ensure your application has write permissions for the directory it's running in
- Try selecting at least one Pok√©mon before attempting to save
