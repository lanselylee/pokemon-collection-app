## About the App
**Pokéllection** is a dynamic web application that lets users browse, search, and collect their favorite Pokémon. The app integrates with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch detailed information for the first 100 Pokémon, including their images, types, and stats.
Users can:
- Explore a catalog of the first 100 Pokémon
- View detailed statistics and type information
- Create and manage custom collections of favorite Pokémon
- Save collections for future reference
